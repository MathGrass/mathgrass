# About this Project

## MathGrass

MathGrass (_**Math**ematical **Gr**aph **Ass**essment_) is a web application that brings automatic assessment to the realm of mathematical graphs.
Its core functionality is the definition of graphs and tasks, which the system presents to participants.
Tasks consist of form-based questions, graphical labeling, or questions which trigger the execution of a instructor-specified _SageMath_ script.
The participants can then interact with the graph in a graph viewer and try to answer the posed questions.
Upon requesting an assessment of the individual answers, the assessment server evaluates the participants' answers and returns the results to the users.
Furthermore, _MathGrass_ supports incremental hints, which simulate instructor assistance and can support the learning experience.

## How to Read This Documentation

This documentation contains the [set of features](features/index.md) that _MathGrass_ provides, information about the usage for either instructors or students. Furthermore, there are notes about the [deployment](deployment/index.md) of a _MathGrass_ instance and  a [developer documentation](developer_guide/quickstart.md).
